SMU Project 1 UFO Sightings

In our project we used a single .csv file from Kaggle for our data: "UFO sightings around the world." Our inital cleaning of the data removed columns that were unusable (ie, column that didn't have the full description of the UFO sighting/encounter). Once we decided on our columns we cleaned up our data so that our dates had the correct syntax, our lat/long coordinates were floats, consolidated our groups of UFO shapes, and narrowed our locations to those in the USA.

With this dataset, with set out to answer the following:
1) Are there trends in the locations of UFO sightings in the United States?
2) If so, do those trends extend to UFO shapes sighted, or the lengths of the encounters?
3) Are there any changes in sighting frequency or locations over time?
4) Is there any significant relationships between sightings and particular times of the year, or points in history?

Our regression looked into finding if there was a relationship between the time of UFO encounters and the latituted and also longitude of encounters.

Through our analysis we looked at the average time of encounters based on US regions. We decided to look at the means of those 5 regions, and test if there was a difference between the pairs of means. We did 10 T-tests to and looked at the p-values to conclude if the means between two regions were the same.
